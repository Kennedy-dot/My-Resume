#input function is a simple way for your program to get information from people using your program.
name = input('Enter your name: ')
print('Hello, ', name)

#BASIC STRUCTURE IS;
#variable name = input(message to user)
#To get numbers from the users to use in calculations;
num = eval(input('Enter a number: '))
print('Your number squared:', num*num)

#The eval function converts the text entered by the user into a number.One nice feature of this is you can enter expressions,like 3*12+5,and eval will compute them for you.
