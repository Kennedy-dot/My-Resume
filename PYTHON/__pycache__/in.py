#The in operator.
#The in operator is used to tell if a string contains something.
# #eg,
# if 'a' in string:
#    print('Your string contains the letter a.)
# You can combine in with the not  operator to tell if a string does not contain something:
# if ';' not in strin:
#    print('Your string does not contain any semicolon. ')


#INDEXING
# we will often want to pick out individual characters from a string.
#eg, in s ='PYTHON'
# s[0] result is P
#s[1] result is Y.
# s[-2] result is O.
